Consider the PDE $\partial_x u + 2x\partial_y u  = 0$ on the domain $y>0$ with the boundary condition $u(x,0) = g(x)$
\begin{question}
  \textbf{(a)} Show that the boundary hyperplane $\{y=0\}  $ is non-characteristic at $(x,0)$, except for $x=0$.
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
Consider the PDE as a function $F(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x},\frac{\partial u}{\partial y},u(x,y),x,y)=0$   then we need to show that : 
\begin{align*}
  \partial_{p_{1}} F(p_{0},p_{1},z,x,y) \neq 0
.\end{align*}
In our case : 
\begin{align*} 
  \partial_{p_{1}} F(p_{0},p_{1},z,x,y)  = \partial_{p_{1}} \left( p_{0} + 2x p_{1} \right)   = 2x
.\end{align*}
Which as required is non zero on $(x,0)$ except for $x=0$
\end{solution}
\begin{question}
  \textbf{(b)}  What condition does the PDE impose on the boundary data g at the point $(0,0)$
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
 At the point $(0,0)$ we know $F(d \frac{g(0)}{dx},p_{1},g(0),0,0) = 0$ but 
 \begin{align*}
  F(d \frac{dg(0)}{dx},p_{1},g(0),0,0) = \frac{dg}{dx}(0) + 2*0*p_{1} =  \frac{dg}{dx}(0) = 0
 .\end{align*}
 The PDE requires g to be constant at $(0,0)$
\end{solution}
\begin{question}
  \textbf{(c)} Determine the characteristic curves of this PDE.
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
 Consider $z(s) = u(x(s),y(s))$  then : 
 \begin{align*}
   z'  = \partial_x u x' + \partial_y y' 
 .\end{align*}
 Choosing $x' = 1 $ and $y' =  2x$ aligns with the PDE such that  
 \begin{align*}
   x(s) &= s +x_{0} \\
   y(s) &= 2xs + y_{0}
 .\end{align*}
 Considering the initial condition 
 \begin{align*}
  z(0) = u(x(0),y(0)) =  u(x_{0},0)
 .\end{align*}
 Meaning $y(s) = 2xs$ this leads to : 
 \begin{align*}
   z(s) = u(x_{0}+s,2xs) = g(x_{0})
 .\end{align*}
 For $(x,y)$ we get : 
 \begin{align*}
   x_{0} &= x-s  \\
   s     &= \frac{y}{2x}
 .\end{align*}
 Such that : 
 \begin{align*}
  u(x,y)  = g(x-\frac{y}{2x})
 .\end{align*}
\end{solution}
\begin{question}
 By considering the $y$-derivative of u on the boundary hyperplane, show that there is no $\mathcal{C}^{1} $ solution with the initial data $g(x) = x$
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
% On the boundary hyperplane $H = \{y=0\}  $ we have by (a) that it is non characteristic at $(x,0)$ except for $x=0$ 
% This means that : 
% \begin{align*}
%   \frac{\partial F}{\partial p_{1}}(\frac{dg(0)}{dx},p_{1},z,0,0) = 0 
% .\end{align*}
% Which requires $\frac{dg}{dx}$ to be constant ? idk dude, i think the issue is that g needs to be constant but it isnt
By (b) we know that the PDE requires $g'= 0$ at $(0,0)$ but for initial data $g(x) = x $ we get $\frac{dg}{dx}(0) = 1 \neq 0$, such that no $\mathcal{C}^{1} $ solution may exist,
other way is using that $H = \{y=0\}  $ is non-characteristic at $(0,0)$
\end{solution}

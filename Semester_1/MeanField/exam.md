Chapter 2 completetly:
    Given a mean field problem, check wether the problem is well posed
    and definitions are satisfied,
Solving Makean-Vlasov : 
    Pick (Focus) Either Chapter 3 or 4 , both the same really 
        - Proof strategies 
        - Why could it work
        - Important estimates
    If you pick Chapter 4 :
        Background not as important in 4 i.e. sobolev spaces etc.
        Important working with heat kernel and the background there. 
        Know the important bounds for the Fixpoint proof
    Mostly proof ideas, less details
Chapter 5 and 6 for Bonus points at most



Knowing Structure mostly enough for 2 
If time isnt enough concentrate on Chapter 2.
The technical details give the 1
I.e. know the analysis techniques for worse regularity etc.


Youre allowed to bring notes. Everything bascially as long as it doesnt turn out to be 
just reading from the notes.

For speical V, check gradient estimates etc., so basic caluclations

With exam on the 8th , mostly ask questions before christmas.
(4th - 5th office hour only on demand )
